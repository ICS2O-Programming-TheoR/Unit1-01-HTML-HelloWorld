  <h1>Why I like Science</h1>
  <p>I love science because there is so much to learn about so many different things. In science, new things are always being discovered every day so there is always an opportunity to learn something new.</p>
  <h4>Why I dislike Language Arts</h4>
  <p>The main reason I dislike Language Arts is that when answering a question there is no one concrete answer that you can say is one-hundred correct, you have to make guesses and inferences to the text to be able to come up with your answer.</p>
